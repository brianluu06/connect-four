 # Initial planning
I generally want to make a simple Connect-Four game but it turns out, making this game was a little complicated. This game has a familiar concept as the game Tic-Tac-Toe game.

I started by doing simple pseudocodes and the requirements needed for this game.
After i started doing my pseudocode, i wanted to make a theme, so i made a Galaxy Star theme.

# Effects

I began by doing simply layout of html and css and doing a 7-6 grid pattern. First, i wanted to make this a desktop and a mobile version so people can play anywhere they like.
This game has sound effects!
Red has a electricity sound effect and Yellow has a light saber sound effect.

# Unsolved problems:
 Once in a blue moon, there will be a tie game, but still can continue playing.
 
 Can Play on All Desktop Versions, and some mobile version unfortunately. I wanted to do both.
